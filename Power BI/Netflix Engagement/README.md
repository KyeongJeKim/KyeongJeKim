About Dataset
Netflix published the first half of 2023 engagement data. This included the hours viewed (rounded to 100,000 hours), the premiere data and whether the title was available globally for Netflix TV series or films.
The dataset aims to supplement this with information scraped from IMDB, including ratings and a brief description.
The dataset includes a genre column containing Python list syntax.
